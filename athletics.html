            <p>We offer a multitude of sports that most other universities don't offer. We have a horseback riding team, a university driven race team in the Formula SAC series, and we also have an eSports team that competes in many different games. We also have the normal sports like football, soccer, lacrosse, wrestling, tennis, basketball, and baseball.</P>
